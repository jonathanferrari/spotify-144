## Description
We are interested in providing personalized music recommendations given a user’s Spotify data. There are multiple routes that we are interested in pursuing and that would be of interest to the user. Some examples include recommending songs based on a playlist, combining multiple users’ song preferences into a shared playlist, creating playlists based on input sentiments, or generating playlists based on other user patterns (eg. seasonal patterns). Machine learning would be an ideal approach because it would extract complexity from the data that would not be intuitively derived. Machine learning is also applicable here since we are working with a large dataset and this amount of data is largely unstructured – the connections between songs that our model will learn are hard for a person to draw due to the vast genres and personalities a person could like, which can defer from one's own personal biases. The methods that we will likely utilize are clustering, word2vec, dimensionality reduction, ensemble learning, and RNNs. Some key stakeholders are music listeners as our model would improve user experience by allowing for additional exploration. Artists and other Spotify collaborators would also benefit, as their products would be introduced to a new audience that they may not have previously reached. Spotify, as a company, would also be a key stakeholder as the increase in user retention not only directly benefits Spotify explicitly with additional users with matches their company mission of bringing music to people but also implicity as their financial stakeholders will now also benefit from the respective expected increase in their stock price, which comes from more users.

## Ideas
- [song2vec](https://algoritmaonline.com/song2vec-music-recommender/)
- 4 Tasks Under Same Overarching Idea:
    - Spotify enhance (suggest new songs to add to existing playlist)
    - Spotify blend (music similarities based on multiple people’s music)
    - Create entirely new playlist from input attributes (this is Jess’ Music final project)
    - Spotify radio stream (Spotify DJ)
